# About
Repository for the [pragmatic mdd blog](http://pragmatic-mdd.blogspot.com).

The idea behind this project is to provide proof of concept and develop a set of best practises for a pragmatic approach to model driven development. 
It should be not based on any existing MDD technology (nothing from OAW, no ATL, no Xpand, no Xtend, no Epsilon, no Eclipse in general), it should be as simple to setup and implement as possible (model definitions in JSON, no metamodels) and flexible enough to support implementation of also a non-standard ("Let's generate some POJOs" type of thing) use cases in a reasonable amount of time.

# Technology
JSON for model definitions, CoffeeScript as implementetion language, Node.js as an execution engine
